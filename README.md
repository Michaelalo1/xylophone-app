# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## My Goal

In this project, I showcased more Dart programming concepts and I used open source Flutter packages and showcased my knowledge on building repeated widgets.


## What I will create

I'm going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
