# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## My Goal

In this tutorial we will be diving into more Dart programming concepts and learning how to use open source Flutter packages. By the end of this module, you should be comfortable using Flutter packages and building repeated widgets.


## What I will create

I'm going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.

## What I implemented

- Incorporating open source libraries of code into your project using Flutter Packages.
- Playing sounds on both iOS and Android.
- Generating repeated user interface Widgets.
- Using Dart functions that can take input arguments as well as return an output.
- Dart arrow syntax for writing one line functions.
